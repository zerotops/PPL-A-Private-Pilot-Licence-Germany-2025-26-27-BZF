# PPL-A-Private-Pilot-Licence-Germany-2025-26-27-BZF

This project is an Obsidian Vault that I have mainly created for myself.

It will contain notes that I make during my journey to becoming a pilot.
Please note that the information provided may be inaccurate, and I wonÂ´t take responsibility for any errors or decisions based on the information I have provided.
I will, of course, try to ensure that everything is correct, but if you notice any errors, please let me know and I will try to fix them.

IMPORTANT !!! = The following information is based on Germany (laws and tests). Some notes might be in German and some in English, so it would be beneficial if you know German.

Status of this project = Still working on it

Good luck on your journey
